# Space-Invaders
The popular game  Space Invaders, I am sure we all heard about. Have you ever wondered how is it made or what goes into creating those aliens that we all love killing with our cool space ship? If you did than have a look at my first ever coding project of your favorite game, where I unraveled all those mysteries.
lets look into the complete description of this code now:

Title Screen:
The game begins with a title screen displaying the message "Press Any Key To Continue" and the title "SPACE INVADERS BY FIZA."
Users can start the game by pressing any key.

Player Controls:
The player controls a spaceship using the keyboard arrow keys.
Left Arrow (A): Move the spaceship to the left.
Right Arrow (D): Move the spaceship to the right.
Up Arrow (W): Move the spaceship upward.
Down Arrow (S): Move the spaceship downward.
Spacebar: Fire bullets from the spaceship.

Game Elements:
Player Spaceship: Represented by a white ellipse and a green rectangular base at the bottom of the screen.
Aliens: Invading aliens are represented by red rectangles with blue ellipses on top.
Bullets: Fired by the player's spaceship to destroy the aliens. Displayed as white lines.
Score: The player's score is displayed on the screen. Each hit increases the score by 100 points.

Game Mechanics:
The aliens move horizontally across the screen and drop down when reaching the edges.
The player's goal is to shoot and destroy the invading aliens while avoiding collisions.
The game continues until the player either wins by destroying all aliens or loses by either being hit by an alien or letting an alien reach the bottom.

Win/Lose Conditions:
Win: The player wins when all aliens are destroyed. A "You Won" message is displayed.
Lose: The player loses if an alien collides with the player's spaceship. A "You Dead" message is displayed.

Scoring and High Score:
The player earns points for each alien destroyed, and the score is displayed on the screen.
The game maintains a high score that is saved to a file ("Score.txt").
The high score is displayed alongside the current score.

Game Pause:
The player can pause the game by pressing the 'P' key. A "Game Paused" message is displayed.
The player can resume the game by pressing 'P' again.

Endless Gameplay:
The game offers endless gameplay, allowing players to continue playing until they win or lose.

Additional Notes:
The game uses a simple ASCII-based graphics library for drawing shapes and text.
The program structure involves functions for player movement, bullet firing, alien movement, collision detection, and overall game logic.
The game includes visual and auditory feedback, with beeping sounds for certain events.
Overall, this Space Invaders game provides a classic gaming experience with basic controls, scoring mechanics, and a simple yet engaging visual style.
